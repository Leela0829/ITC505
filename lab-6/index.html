            <strong>Project Overview:</strong>Visitors of the site would be able take the BMI Calculator, which helps them figure the levels of BMI by entering weight to height ratio. Users may decide on the number of cm they measure or the number of inches in the case of imperial system. The calculator will display also a BMI number that relates to the users weight status.

        <p>
            <strong>Implementation Details:</strong>A JavaScript code which handles user input is utilized by BMI calculator. JavaScript will get the users' height and weight upon the submission of the form and make the calculation for BMI via division by height with their square, and then classify the status as someone is underweight or overweight depending on the preset ranges. BMI is calculated and displayed on the homepage showing a personâ€™s weight classification after which In CSS, formatting, and designing of the entire body of a model are done, and in HTML, the form and output parts are created.

        <p>
            <strong>Challenges and Solutions:</strong>Accurate conversion and management of incorrect inputs was a big problem. To solve this, exact formulae were used for BMI conversions and input validation was put into place. A responsive and user-friendly user interface was another difficulty, but this was accomplished with the use of contemporary style methods and the CSS Grid layout.
        <p>
            <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong>I now have a stronger grasp of form input processing, responsive web design using CSS Grid, and JavaScript event handling thanks to this project. It also reaffirmed how crucial it is for online apps to validate user input and provide unambiguous user feedback.
